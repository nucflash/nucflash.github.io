Here I list a bunch of recent ones that I\u2019m particularly fond of: Content 904Labs self-learning search engine Streamwatchr Periscope Predicting IMDB movie ratings 904Labs self-learning search engine \u00b6 904Labs self-learning search engine (904SLS) is the first commercially available self-learning search engine for e-commerce and content publishers. It optimizes search results from user behavior for increasing conversion. 904SLS offers all core aspects of search: from pre-search, e.g., query understanding, to automatic document augmentation and post-search, e.g., result re-ranking. The engine is able to update in near real-time so that it can quickly adapt to swift changes in user search behavior, without retraining. 904SLS is available as software-as-a-service or virtual machine, and it can re-use the existing search infrastructure if it is Lucene-based so that no re-indexing is required. The amount of engineering that our team has put in, given the timeframe and human resources, is, in my opinion, mind blowing. We\u2019ve had to solve core machine learning limitations (e.g., delayed feedback), scalability challenges (i.e., minimize latency whithout harming effectiveness), and domain-dependent challenges (i.e., how much search is eCommerce search?), but also to setup a full-blown infrastructure with experimental, staging, and production environments so that our customers have no down-time when we push new features to production. The results have been rewarding; 904SLS outperforms state-of-the-art learning-to-rank systems in academic datasets , and it has proven to uplift revenue by 30% on live, e-commerce shops . Streamwatchr \u00b6 Streamwatchr listened to the world and tried to understand what was happening. It monitored Twitter to find out to which music people were listening. Streamwatchr offered real-time insights into music listening behavior around the world. It ran from 2013 until 2016. The millions of tweets and the hundreds of thousands of artists that Streamwatchr has listened to over the years have been distilled to a handful of noteworthy factoids: tweets listened 438,225,941 artists seen 660,941 most popular song Passenger\u2009\u2013\u2009Let Her Go, 196,986 times most sung along song John Legend\u2009\u2013\u2009All of Me, 541 times The engineering behind Streamwatchr was impressive. Streamwatchr collected music-related tweets, extracted songs and artists, mapped these to a MusicBrainz, a music database, and to YouTube video clips, all in real-time. All information shown on Streamwatchr was refreshed with every single tweet, from popularity charts, music analytics, trending music, and song recommendations. Streamwatchr used a stack of Python, and MongoDB for analytics and recommendations. Most of the magic behind real-time updates relied on clever data structures and algorithms that minimized the amount of updates needed. Periscope \u00b6 Periscope was a project that highlighted what topics on Twitter will break viral before they did. It was meant for media analysts to keep ahead of the curve and for average users to keep the clutter away. Predicting IMDB movie ratings \u00b6 Part of the Artificial Intelligence Masters programme in which I used to teach was one month hands-on project. I have supervised Andrei Oghina and Mathias Breuss on whether can we predict a movie\u2019s IMDB rating from social media before the movie is out . Andrei and Mathias collected tweets about movies and their respective YouTube trailers, and they extracted several features which were used for training a rating classifier. We have found out that we are able predict a movie\u2019s IMDB rating with \u00b10.25 accuracy. That is if a movie gets an average IMDB rating of 8, we would predict 7.75 or 8.25.

In our talk, I described the importance of search in e-commerce by giving examples of failed searches in a number of settings, from finding advertized items using onsite search to mobile search. I followed by with why people choose Amazon to start their product search and highlighted that 54% of them choose Amazon because of their great search functionality\u2013that is the reason number five for people to go to Amazon. Then, I explained why optimizing the ranking manually is close to impossible for humans by laying out the insane amount of options available and enumerating the search space (which can be at millions of millions of choices). With this as foundation, I talked about machine learning and the particular type of machine learning that we use at 904Labs for optimizing search rankings in real-time. I followed up with describing our query intent engine, which is powered by 904Sense, and our automatic synonym extraction engine. In my conclusions, I re-iterated that A.I. for Search can boost search-driven revenue by 30% and that search is becoming part of platforms.

This year ECIR was held in Grenoble, France. With more than 250 attendants and 4 days packed with tutorials, workshops, research, and industry talks, it was a great place to be to get updated with the latest and greatest about search engines. The theme of this year\u2019s Industry Day was to bring lessons learned from industry to academia. What are differences when developing a research algorithm and when we bring to practice? These lessons could inspire and inform our fellow academics for the challenges practitioners face when bring these algorithms to production. In my talk I touched upon a bunch of challenges we\u2019ve faced at 904Labs and how we came about to solving them. Open questions revolve around online learning to rank algorithms, delayed feedback, design of new metrics to avoid embarassing results, and the importance of investing in an evaluation platform. At 904Labs we have come a long way and we have working answers for these questions, however, as these questions are particularly difficult to answer, I\u2019ve invited people to drop me a note with ideas, if they are interested. I\u2019ve already got some nice feedback, and I hope to see more research on these areas in the near future!

On 31 May, I was invited to give a talk at TECH Talks in Amsterdam . TECH Talks is a new meetup organized by Techloop.io , a new way for matching jobs and talent in IT. My talk revolved on how we built an e-commerce focused search engine using machine learning (or as most people know it, A.I.). The meetup had a great start with more than 200 registered people and more than 100 people showed up; the room at TQ was at its maximum capacity! The audience was diverse with a nice mix of frontend, backend , senior and junior engineers, and also people from other disciplines who are interested in keeping up with latest developments in IT and e-commerce. Techloop and TQ were great organizers providing a great atmosphere (pizza and beer, included) facilitating great chats and networks afterwards.

If you don\u2019t know what a Query Intent/Understanding engine is, here\u2019s some background ; otherwise keep reading. Our Query Intent/Understanding engine is closing to one year old, and it\u2019s pretty cool: it can quickly boostrap a knowledge graph and continuously update it straight from our customer\u2019s data. Since its introduction in September 2017, it has been tested in many different domains and languages and has shown substantial revenue uplift across customers. In the last couple of weeks, our team has been busy tweaking our engine and pushing it even further. Our Query Intent/Understanding engine was doing already a good job, mapping query free text to product attributes such as category, or brands. However, we\u2019ve never tested going deeper into particular product attributes, such the product weight or even, wattage. Our engineers managed to extend the logic and the scalability of the algorithm to support very fine grained suggestions, if such fine-grained information exists in the index. It is quite a feat and I\u2019m very proud of our team! On top of the engineering feat, the algorithm itself is pretty lean and has quite a few distinctive features that are hard to find in other engines: it does not depend on external dependencies (read Wikipedia), nor it needs periodic re-training. The only thing that a customer has to do is to plug in our system to a Apache Solr/Elasticsearch, and 904Labs Query Intent engine is built incrementally, one click/add-to-basket/purchase at a time. Oh, and it doesn\u2019t write anything on your index. Magic! Here\u2019s a few interesting examples that came out from today\u2019s experimentation: (the examples are in Dutch; I try to translate the queries into English. Field attributes and values may be partially redacted for anonymity) Some relatively simple cases \u00b6 The system learns to map the query: lampen (lamps) to Solr\u2019s directive: category:Lampen . Learning of this mapping is automatic and based on only from user interactions. Query: Tent \u2192 category:Tenten . Note how the system has learned the mapping from singular to plural without using of manual synonyms. Query: Stoel kussens (chair pillows) \u2192 category:Kussens (pillows). In this example, the system maps a specific query to a broader category. This highlights a productive synergy between human and machine: the site\u2019s taxonomy lacked a dedicated leaf node for chair pillows, so the system intelligently selected the closest broader category. This choice influences the downstream learning-to-rank process, bringing greater focus to the broader category of pillows. Some more difficult cases \u00b6 Query: Bed 160x200 \u2192 size:160x200 cm and size:160 x 200 cm . Note how the system has learned the discrepency in attribute values and suggests both; in the first one there are no spaces in the representation of the dimension, in the second one there are. Query: stoelen (chairs) \u2192 category:... en eetkamerstoelen (kitchens and dining chairs). Here the system attempts to infer the intented category for a broad query such as \u201cchairs\u201d. Although there is a category labeled \u201cchairs\u201d, the system decides to suggest a particular leaf within the taxonomy branch of chairs. Query: tuinset (garden set) \u2192 number_of_persons:12 . The system implicitly defines the size and dimensions of the garden set from historical user behavior. Given the lack of a user profile, suggestions like this aim at capturing the interests of the average user of the shop. Some very difficult cases \u00b6 Finally, two of my favorites, where the system attempts to infer several attributes of products from broad queries\u2014 Query: prieel (garden house) \u2192 material:XXX, color:Beige, weight:4.9 kg . Here the system maps a broad query to distinct set of attributes, i.e., the material, the color, and even the weight of the garden house. Again, with no user profile provided, these suggestions attempt to capture the interests of the average user of the shop. Query: eenpersoons bed (one person bed) \u2192 size:90 x 200 cm . The system maps the query to exact dimensions for the bed! Query: XXX lounge (brand redacted) \u2192 model:White XXX . Here the system manages to map a brand and type of products from this brand to a specific product model from this brand. Again, without user profiling. Quite impressive! I hope you also find exciting what the new version of 904Labs Query Intent/Understanding engine can do. You can have this technology working for you too and straight away, by getting in touch with us .

If you are in the search engine/information retrieval community, you know the term and how challenging the problem is. But if you are not familiar with the problem, it is hard to grasp its importance and challenges. Here\u2019s my attempt to explain it in simple words. A Query Intent/Understanding engine aims at identifying the intent of a user\u2019s query and ultimately at translating it to a set of search directives. Consider a user coming to your e-shop and typing in the search box: \u201cred shoes\u201d. The query may look pretty straightforward to you when it comes to what products to show to the user but, for a machine, it\u2019s pretty hard to figure out what the person meant. To get into the machine\u2019s shoes (pun intended) think for a moment that you were born and raised in a warehouse, which is isolated from the rest of the world but has all the inventory of an e-shop. You\u2019ve never left the warehouse so you don\u2019t know anything about the world. It\u2019s quite grim world but bare with me. One day someone slips a message under the door of the warehouse with the words \u201cred shoes\u201d. Now your task is to select a set of products that satisfy/cover that person\u2019s information need. Obviously you know nothing about that mysterious person, let alone their preferences, and you barely understand the language of the message\u2013perhaps you are able to recognize characters and words and match them to words found on the labels of products, but that\u2019s pretty much it. In such a surreal world, you can imagine that it is quite difficult, even for you, a human, to select a set of products that relate to \u201cred shoes\u201d. The challenge lies in that much of the important, contextual, information that we have access to from our constant interactions with the real world by living in it, it is very much missing in this artificial setting: We don\u2019t know whether the user is a he or a she (and therefore we don\u2019t know if we should pick male or female type of shoes), we don\u2019t know what is the \u201chot\u201d color of the season, nor the most popular brand, nor whether the person is looking for sneakers or boots or high-heels. There are lots of unknowns. A Query Intent/Understanding engine is an algorithm that tries to make sense of the world for machines, or other entities, which are locked up in a similar warehouse as the one we described above and have no access to contextual information. A Query Intent/Understanding algorithm aims at mapping free text (a user query) to a series of directives (rules) that when applied, they will yield a useful set of products for the user. In our \u201cred shoes\u201d example, we are looking for directives that look as the following: \u201cfilter on products that have attribute:red and category:shoes\u201d. At a first glance, the mapping looks simple but as of now you\u2019ve seen from our warehouse setting that it can be quite daunting. Researchers and practitioners have been working on this problem for quite some time and progress has been made; however the community has still some way to go before solving it. At the core of current solutions, there is a lot of complex technology such as neural networks that power NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools and other pipelines that require lots of human annotations (read expensive). These approaches yield relatively good accuracy, however, putting these systems into production may still be a challenging engineering problem\u2013from setting up the data pipelining to scaling up, to retraining, and to monitoring system effectiveness and efficiency. At 904Labs we\u2019ve developed a Query Intent/Understanding engine that hooks up on an e-shop\u2019s data, bootstraps a knowledge graph, and it learns the mapping to directives automatically, i.e., without supervision (read without human annotations). It doesn\u2019t require retraining nor external dependencies, and you can use it straight away, today, on your own Apache Solr or Elasticsearch index (from which we only read and never write and we never lock you in).

There were three tracks: A.I., IoT, and Blockchain, with the latter two dominating the exhibitors list. It was an intense two days, with lots of people dropping by 904Labs\u2019 booth and asking about what we do and how 904Labs search technology can help them in their settings. Altough the average visitor profile was not looking for onsite search, we had good chats with a bunch of Dutch and international and small, medium, and big companies on how onsite search can help their endeavors. We talked on how search technology is underneath many applications, including chatbots, and self-service applications. No matter the application, good search can help increase revenue in the setting of selling products, or reduce costs in the setting of self-service as visitors are better able to find the information they\u2019re looking for without calling the company\u2019s call centre.

Instead I wrote down some thoughts on interesting problems, ideas and challenges in the e-commerce domain. Here they are: The vocabulary gap is still an open problem. \u00b6 People refer to products in different ways that products are described in the catalogue. Neural networks, learning to rank, query intent engines are all important. Our experience at 904Labs shown that a query intent engine that boosts specific product categories given a query, boosts our learning to rank system by more than 16% in additional revenue. These results suggest that effective initial ranking is very important for effective learning to rank. To this end, we foresee an increasing interest in methods that can re-rank the entire collection and not only the top-N documents. This is particularly important for larger shops with large inventories (more than hundred of thousands of items) where a query can return hundreds of items, and only the top few are re-ranked. E-commerce search is as much as about exploration as it is about finding the best match. \u00b6 From our experience at 904Labs, we see a large fraction of queries to revolve around categories, or combinations of categories, e.g., red shoes , kitchen tables , dvd players , ebooks for 12 years old . This type of queries go beyond our typical search and require understanding the query and generating a list of recommended relevant items. This proposition is supported by the surprising effectiveness of sorting by popularity; the most popular items for a query are potential good candidates for this \u201crecommendation list\u201d that the user is looking for. Back to query understanding of this type of exploratory queries, one would think that natural language processing can help here but in the e-commerce setting, queries are very short and any language analysis falls short. An open question here is how can we go from these broad queries to a good set of recommendations? A natural way is to devise a hybrid system of search and recommendations: We fire the query to a search system and then we take the first few items as seed to a recommender system for getting similar items. Or a system that transforms a query to an image (think AttnGAN or similar) and each product to an image and then rank documents by their image similarity to the query\u2019s\u2013the image representation may constraint the latent space, abstract the language of the query and that of the document and be able to capture semantics that are otherwise difficult to encode in textual form. The image representation of queries and documents also offers explainability when it comes to explaining the rankings of the system; which is becoming increasingly important in machine learning-based systems. Evaluation metrics in e-commerce. \u00b6 There are several directions here that we need do more work. First, the e-commerce setting is a conjunction of exploratory search, typical search, and recommendations. Using the standard IR precision and recall measures for e-commerce may not tell us the entire story for how happy makes its users. We need to discover the aspects of a system that makes users happy for designing one or more metrics for evaluating search and recommendation systems. These metrics should also correlate well with revenue but also with customer loyalty (measured in returning customers and in shortening the time between returns). Such a metric (or a multiple of metrics) will then allow us to run offline experiments and make predictions on revenue, which is the main KPI that systems are evaluated in production for most e-commerce business. Last, an extra tip: we found that boolean scoring may be on par or outperform tf.idf or BM25 scoring in the e-commerce domain, it\u2019s worth checking its effectiveness on your own data ;)","title":"Inlieu of an Invited Talk\u2014Thoughts on the Future of Search in E-commerce"},{"location":"posts/20190718-ecommerce-workshop/#the-vocabulary-gap-is-still-an-open-problem","text":"People refer to products in different ways that products are described in the catalogue.

Wouter and I founded 904Labs in late 2014 and embarked in an adventure of becoming entrepreneurs while holding tight to our scientist trait. We took courses in entrepreneurship, joined our university\u2019s startup incubator, poured all the money we had saved by that moment in the company, and we set sail for bringing state-of-the-art search to the masses. A lot has happened in these five years. We met with incredible people in all ranks, involved in from local startups to worldwide multinationals. Each one helped us in their own way, from validating our ideas, shaping our product-A.I. for Search-, to running pilots. We received support from our university, University of Amsterdam, through grants and loans, which helped us go through the development phase of our product and bring it to the market. Within a year since we started, we grew from just two founders to a team of six, and our code base went from a bunch of scripts to a full blown, distributed, horizontally scalable, multi-tenant architecture. In our second year we ran our first pilot, with massive success: A.I. for Search managed to increase search driven revenue by 38% ! The same year we had our first big customer and the year after a second, bigger one. By 2019, A.I. for Search has served searches from more than 15 countries and an equal number of languages. It has battled and won in more than 10 A/B tests, in all of which it has proven to substantially increase search driven revenue. Tech-wise, 904Labs has been success story, really. Business-wise, the story is slightly different. Wouter and I, our business developers and salespeople, found it hard to sell A.I. for Search. Customers were excited with the tech and the potential, but the deals were not closing. We\u2019ve been banging our heads against the wall for a long time but didn\u2019t manage to find a solution to why the deals were not closing, at least not early enough. Three years in and without a good customer base, we\u2019ve hit a financial storm. We had to let all of our people go, and our offices as well. Despite the financial stress, we decided to keep the company running while hoping for better days; we minimized all possible expenses to squeeze out all the time we could buy until new deals come in\u2013which would allow us to reboot the company. Two years since, we didn\u2019t manage to close new deals, but the epiphany we were looking for since our early days stroke us: deals weren\u2019t closing because we\u2019ve been targeting a very narrow and difficult customer segment, which was insufficient to sustain the company growth we needed and wished for. The realization hit us hard. We spent a lot of time thinking of alternatives but couldn\u2019t find a satisfying alternative. In the beginning of 2019, one of our two customers left, and their departure marked the beginning of winding down 904Labs. We decided that despite the difficult customer segment we chose to target, 904Labs\u2019 tech was still magical and had to remain with the world no matter what was the future of 904Labs as company. We\u2019ve reached out to anyone and any entity that we believed our tech will be useful: our professional network, potential customers, competitors. We offered a one time license to our source code. After taking hold of the code one would be able to do whatever they want with it. In the one time license fee, we included our latest version of our code base, our infrastructure, documentation, our processes, and, of course, onsite training and support. We\u2019ve been actively talking with a few companies now, and they will bring in A.I. for Search to either complement and strengthen their offering, or to use it internally in different projects. The next few quarters may bring the company of 904Labs to an end, but its tech will survive, and it will keep helping people find what they\u2019re looking for; by learning from one click at a time, as it used to. As to what Wouter and I are up to next, it has been a tough decision but we\u2019re on good and exciting new paths. Wouter has joined Zeta-Alpha-Vector , a Dutch deep learning research company based in Amsterdam, and I\u2019m joining Apple in California to work with the Siri Understanding team. While at 904Labs, we both learned so much: building and running a business, developing a product, managing engineering and sales teams. It\u2019s been an invaluable experience. 904Labs gifted us the knowledge of what it takes to build a product in the real-world, which is very different from what we had in mind when we left Academia. By now we know that a product needs to be fun from a tech/scientific perspective but it is equally important to satisfy customers needs and solve specific problems\u2013at the same time it is bound by limited resources, either be it time, people, or budget. Finding the right balance on all three dimensions is key to product success. The lesson may have come late for 904Labs, but we are excited to be able to apply this hard earned knowledge as well as earlier and newly acquired skills to new environments and challenges! Before waving goodbye, we would like to take a moment and extend a big thank you to everyone who has been involved with 904Labs, directly or indirectly: Our customers, engineers, sales people, university, mentors, shareholders, network, and last, but not least, our families and friends who\u2019ve been very supportive throughout this entire journey. It\u2019s been a fun ride but not always easy. We wouldn\u2019t have made it so far without their support.

We introduce a method that uses historical user interactions to forecast which entities will gain in popularity and become trending, and it subse- quently integrates the predictions within the Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) component of the VA. Experiments show that our proposed approach results in a 20% relative reduction in errors on emerging entity name utterances without degrading the overall recognition quality of the system.

Entropy pruning results in smaller models but with significant degradation of effectiveness in the tail of the user request distribution. We customize entropy pruning by allowing for a keep list of infrequent n-grams that require a more relaxed pruning threshold, and propose three methods to construct the keep list. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages with respect to LM size, ASR accuracy and cost of constructing the keep list. Our best LM gives 8% average Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on a targeted test set, but is 3 times larger than the baseline. We also propose discriminative methods to reduce the size of the LM while retaining the majority of the WER gains achieved by the largest LM.
